Early Words  â€˜Early words' is an abstract model of the fascinating language acquisition process of 18 to 36 month olds. It aims to cast light on word comprehension and production. The data used is intentionally cross-linguistic to serve as a reminder that multiple languages can be acquired simultaneously in the same abstract space of the mind and be enriched by it.   This piece is an encounter with human first sounds and words. The words displayed are filtered by age, but not by language.  Eggs hatch to reveal words acquired by the hypothetical multilingual toddler. The words occupy a space above the grassy globe made out of the sounds of babbling. Today, out of approximately seven thousand known languages, only a handful are dominant. Words from all languages are valued equally in this abstract space.   Primary data source: Frank, M.
