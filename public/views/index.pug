    //h1 Early words
    //p#explanation1 â€˜Early words' is an abstract model of the fascinating language acquisition process of 18 to 36 month olds. It aims to cast light on the comprehension process with that of motor function and actual production. The data used is intentionally cross-linguistic to serve as a reminder that multiple languages can be simultaneously acquired in the same abstract space and be enriched by it. 
    //p#explanation1 This piece is an encounter with human first sounds and words. The words displayed are filtered by age, but not by language.  Eggs hatch to reveal words acquired by the hypothetical multilingual toddler. The words occupy a space above the grass made out of the sounds of babbling. Today, out of approximately seven thousand known languages, only a handful are dominant. Words from all languages are valued equally in this abstract space.
